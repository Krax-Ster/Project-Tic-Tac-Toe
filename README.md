# Project-Tic-Tac-Toe

Project Tic-Tac-Toe is the first official project taken up by the infamous group know as Blackfyre Rebellion.
The group aims to bring joy to peoples faces by ensuring their tic-tac-toe games are less boring and last longer than the average tic-tac-toe game played on a 3 x 3 grid.

Hence, Project "Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe" was concoted in the secret lair of the group to make sure human evolution accelerates because for the first time ever,
people will be using their brains to strategise and think a few moves ahead in order to assure they achieve the "Ultimate" victory. A sore loser might do
sore loser things and say they lost because they lost because the game was too short. But with this evil plan by Blackfyre Rebellion, this excuse will no
longer be valid because be honest, even a sore loser will remain as such when there is a way out. However, with 9 games potentially, there is literally
no hope for our "ULTIMATE" aim of human evolution through this game if such a person really exists, as they are unable to adapt and evolve their abilities 
to survive the next game.

That's the short story behind our reason of developing this game, hope You have fun and achieve the "ULTIMATE" experience.

Yours holiness,
Storm (aka Derrick Asiedu Aboagye for those who don't know :( )
